Phosphoproteomic screening of H1N1 virus-infected cells revealed that NS1 was phosphorylated at serine 205 in intermediate stages of the viral life cycle. Interestingly, S205 is one of six amino acid changes in NS1 of post-pandemic H1N1 viruses currently circulating in humans compared to the original swine-origin 2009 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) virus, suggesting a role in host adaptation. To identify NS1 functions regulated by S205 phosphorylation, we generated recombinant PR8 H1N1 NS1 mutants with S205G (nonphosphorylatable) or S205N (H1N1pdm09 signature), as well as H1N1pdm09 viruses harboring the reverse mutation NS1 N205S or N205D (phosphomimetic). Replication of PR8 NS1 mutants was attenuated relative to wild-type (WT) virus replication in a porcine cell line. However, PR8 NS1 S205N showed remarkably higher attenuation than PR8 NS1 S205G in a human cell line, highlighting a potential host-independent advantage of phosphorylatable S205, while an asparagine at this position led to a potential host-specific attenuation. Interestingly, PR8 NS1 S205G did not show polymerase activity-enhancing functions, in contrast to the WT, which can be attributed to diminished interaction with cellular restriction factor DDX21. Analysis of the respective kinase mediating S205 phosphorylation indicated an involvement of casein kinase 2 (CK2). CK2 inhibition significantly reduced the replication of WT viruses and decreased NS1-DDX21 interaction, as observed for NS1 S205G. In summary, NS1 S205 is required for efficient NS1-DDX21 binding, resulting in enhanced viral polymerase activity, which is likely to be regulated by transient phosphorylation.', '33278394': \"AIMS: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection accelerates the inflammatory injury of lung epithelial cells that contributes to pulmonary lesion. Recently, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) was found to mediate cellular immune response and participated in lung tumorigenesis. Our study aimed to illustrate the function and mechanism of STIM1 in IAV-induced inflammation injury and oxidative stress of lung epithelial cells.\\nMAIN METHODS: We evaluated the levels of STIM1 in IAV-infected patients' serum and BEAS-2B cells using RT-qPCR, Elisa and western blotting methods. MTT and Elisa were performed to measure cell viability and cytokine contents. Besides, ROS intensity, SOD contents and cell apoptosis were detected based on DCFH-DA probe, colorimetry and cell death kits. A luciferase assay and Pearson's correlation analysis evaluated the associations between target genes.\\nKEY FINDINGS: STIM1 was dramatically up-regulated in IAV-infected patients' serum and BEAS-2B cells. Silencing STIM1 in vitro inhibited oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by IAV, and reversed cell viability and suppressed apoptosis. Moreover, miR-223 and NLRP3 were negatively and positively correlated with STIM1. STIM1 was found to regulate NLRP3 expression by binding the AACUGAC motif in miR-223. STIM1/miR-223/NLRP3 axis modulated IAV-induced inflammation injury of lung epithelial cells.\\nSIGNIFICANCE: Our evidence indicated that silencing STIM1 alleviated IAV-induced inflammation injury of lung epithelial cells by inactivating NLRP3 and inflammasome via promoting miR-223 expression. These findings may contribute to understand the mechanism of IAV-induced lung injury and help for therapy of IAV infection.\", '33172261': \"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly contagious human pathogen that is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a crucial protein expressed by IAV to evade the host immune system. Additionally, NS1 has been proposed to stimulate translation because of its ability to bind poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G. We analyzed the interaction of NS1 with PABP1 using quantitative techniques. Our studies show that NS1 binds as a homodimer to PABP1, and this interaction is conserved across different IAV strains. Unexpectedly, NS1 does not bind to PABP1 that is bound to poly(A) RNA. Instead, NS1 binds only to PABP1 free of RNA, suggesting that stimulation of translation does not occur by NS1 interacting with the PABP1 molecule attached to the mRNA 3'-poly(A) tail. These results suggest that the function of the NS1·PABP1 complex appears to be distinct from the classical role of PABP1 in translation initiation, when it is bound to the 3'-poly(A) tail of mRNA.\", '32631335': 'BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a serious public health problem not only in South East Asia but also in European and African countries. Scientists are using network biology to dig deep into the essential host factors responsible for regulation of virus infections. Researchers can explore the virus invasion into the host cells by studying the virus-host relationship based on their protein-protein interaction network.\\nMETHODS: In this study, we present a comprehensive IAV-host protein-protein interaction network that is obtained based on the literature-curated protein interaction datasets and some important interaction databases. The network is constructed in Cytoscape and analyzed with its plugins including CytoHubba, CytoCluster, MCODE, ClusterViz and ClusterOne. In addition, Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses are performed on the highly IAV-associated human proteins. We also compare the current results with those from our previous study on Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-host protein-protein interaction network in order to find out valuable information.\\nRESULTS: We found out 1027 interactions among 829 proteins of which 14 are viral proteins and 815 belong to human proteins. The viral protein NS1 has the highest number of associations with human proteins followed by NP, PB2 and so on. Among human proteins, LNX2, MEOX2, TFCP2, PRKRA and DVL2 have the most interactions with viral proteins. Based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the highly IAV-associated human proteins, we found out that they are enriched in the KEGG pathway of basal cell carcinoma. Similarly, the result of KEGG analysis of the common host factors involved in IAV and HCV infections shows that these factors are enriched in the infection pathways of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Viral Carcinoma, measles and certain other viruses.\\nCONCLUSION: It is concluded that the list of proteins we identified might be used as potential drug targets for the drug design against the infectious diseases caused by Influenza A Virus and other viruses.', '32326380': 'Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding single-stranded RNA, which play an important role in modulating host-Influenza A virus (IAV) crosstalk. The interplay between influenza and miRNA interaction is defined by a plethora of complex mechanisms, which are not fully understood yet. Here, we demonstrate that in IAV infected A549 cells, a synchronous increase was observed in the expression of mTOR up to 24 hpi and significant downregulation at 48 hpi. Additionally, NP of IAV interacts with mTOR and modulates the levels of mTOR mRNA and protein, thus regulating the translation of host cell. RNA sequencing and qPCR analysis of IAV-infected A549 cells and NP transfected cells revealed that miR-101 downregulates mTOR transcripts at later stages of infection. Ectopic expression of miR-101 mimic led to a decrease in expression of NP, a reduction in IAV titer and replication. Moreover, treatment of the cells with Everolimus, a potent inhibitor of mTOR, resulted in an increase of miR-101 transcript levels, which further suppressed the viral protein synthesis. Collectively, the data suggest a novel mechanism that IAV stimulates mTOR pathway at early stages of infection; however, at a later time-point, positive regulation of miR-101 restrains the mTOR expression, and hence, the viral propagation.', '32235330': 'Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are highly contagious pathogens infecting human and numerous animals. The viruses cause millions of infection cases and thousands of deaths every year, thus making IAVs a continual threat to global health. Upon IAV infection, host innate immune system is triggered and activated to restrict virus replication and clear pathogens. Subsequently, host adaptive immunity is involved in specific virus clearance. On the other hand, to achieve a successful infection, IAVs also apply multiple strategies to avoid be detected and eliminated by the host immunity. In the current review, we present a general description on recent work regarding different host cells and molecules facilitating antiviral defenses against IAV infection and how IAVs antagonize host immune responses.', '32085430': 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) have been a major public health threat worldwide, and options for antiviral therapy become increasingly limited with the emergence of drug-resisting virus strains. New and effective anti-IAV drugs, especially for highly pathogenic influenza, with different modes of action, are urgently needed. The influenza virus glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) plays critical roles in the early stage of virus infection, including receptor binding and membrane fusion, making it a potential target for the development of anti-influenza drugs. In this study, we show that OA-10, a newly synthesized triterpene out of 11 oleanane-type derivatives, exhibited significant antiviral activity against four different subtypes of IAV (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 and H3N2) replications in A549 cell cultures with EC', '32000791': 'BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to pose serious threats to public health. The current prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions for IAV requires frequent changes due to the continuous antigenic drift and antigenic shift of IAV. Emerging evidence indicates that the host microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. Cellular miRNAs may directly target virus to inhibit its infection and be developed as potential anti-virus drugs.\\nMETHODS: In this study, we established a broad-spectrum anti-IAV miRNA screening method using miRanda software. The screened miRNAs were further verified by luciferase assay, viral protein expression assay and virus replication assay.\\nRESULTS: Five cellular miRNAs (miR-188-3p, miR-345-5p, miR-3183, miR-15-3p and miR-769-3p), targeting 99.96, 95.31, 92.9, 94.58 and 97.24% of human IAV strains recorded in NCBI, respectively, were chosen for further experimental verification. Finally, we found that miR-188-3p downregulated PB2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeted the predicted sites on PB2 and effectively inhibited the replication of IAV (H1N1, H5N6 and H7N9) in A549 cells.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report screening cellular miRNAs that broad-spectrum inhibiting IAV infection. These findings suggested that cellular miR-188-3p could be used for RNAi-mediated anti-IAV therapeutic strategies.', '31940955': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) exploits host factors to multiply and cause disease. An in-depth knowledge of this interaction of IAV with the host will aid the development of anti-IAV intervention strategies. Previously, we demonstrated that host cortactin, an actin filament-binding protein promotes IAV infection, but undergoes degradation via a lysosome-associated apoptotic pathway during the late stages of IAV infection. Next, we wanted to further understand the mechanisms and significance of this phenomenon. By using the RNA interference screens and site-directed mutagenesis followed by western blotting, we found that lysosome protease, cathepsin C is involved in cortactin degradation in human cells infected with IAV. Furthermore, executioner apoptotic caspase, caspase-3 not caspase-6 or caspase-7 is involved in cortactin degradation during IAV infection, and caspase-3 cleavage site is located in the first actin-binding repeat of cortactin polypeptide. Finally, when expressed ectopically, the cleavage-resistant cortactin mutants decreased the amount of IAV progeny released from infected cells that was enhanced by the cleavage-sensitive cortactin wild type. These data strengthen the hypothesis proposed earlier that host cortactin plays an inhibitory role during the late stages of IAV infection, and IAV is facilitating its degradation to undermine such function.', '31915279': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) utilizes multiple strategies to confront or evade host type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses in order to enhance its own propagation within the host. One such strategy is to induce the degradation of type I IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1) by utilizing viral hemagglutinin (HA). However, the molecular mechanism behind this process is poorly understood. Here, we report that a cellular protein, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), plays a critical role in mediating IAV HA-induced degradation of IFNAR1. We identified PARP1 as an interacting partner for IAV HA through mass spectrometry analysis. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Furthermore, confocal fluorescence microscopy showed altered localization of endogenous PARP1 upon transient IAV HA expression or during IAV infection. Knockdown or inhibition of PARP1 rescued IFNAR1 levels upon IAV infection or HA expression, exemplifying the importance of PARP1 for IAV-induced reduction of IFNAR1. Notably, PARP1 was crucial for the robust replication of IAV, which was associated with regulation of the type I IFN receptor signaling pathway. These results indicate that PARP1 promotes IAV replication by controlling viral HA-induced degradation of host type I IFN receptor. Altogether, these findings provide novel insight into interactions between influenza virus and the host innate immune response and reveal a new function for PARP1 during influenza virus infection.', '31902499': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) and bacteria co-infection can influence the host clinical conditions. Both H9N2 IAV and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) are potential pathogens of respiratory diseases in mink. In this study, to clarify the effects of H9N2 IAV and P. aeruginosa co-infections on hemorrhagic pneumonia in mink, we carried out to establish the mink models of the two-pathogen co-infections in different orders. Compared with the single infections with H9N2 IAV or P. aeruginosa, the mink co-infected with H9N2 IAV and P. aeruginosa showed severe respiratory diseases, and exacerbated histopathological lesions and more obvious apoptosis in the lung tissues. H9N2 IAV shedding and viral loads in the lungs of the mink co-infected with H9N2 IAV and P. aeruginosa were higher than those in the mink with single H9N2 IAV infection. Furthermore, the clearance of P. aeruginosa in the co-infected mink lungs was delayed. In addition, the anti-H9N2 antibody titers in mink with P. aeruginosa co-infection following H9N2 IAV infection were significantly higher than those of the other groups. This implied that H9N2 IAV and P. aeruginosa co-infection contributed to the development of hemorrhagic pneumonia in mink, and that P. aeruginosa should play a major role in the disease. The exact interaction mechanism among H9N2 IAV, P. aeruginosa and the host needs to be further investigated.', '31791311': 'BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) is still a major health threat. The clinical manifestations of this infection are related to immune dysregulation, which causes morbidity and mortality. The usage of traditional medication with immunomodulatory properties against influenza infection has been increased recently. Our previous study showed antiviral activity of quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (Q3R) isolated from Rapanea melanophloeos (RM) (L.) Mez (family Myrsinaceae) against H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) infection. This study aimed to confirm the wider range of immunomodulatory effect of Q3R on selective pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines against IAV in vitro, to evaluate the effect of Q3R on apoptosis pathway in combination with H1N1, also to assess the physical interaction of Q3R with virus glycoproteins and RhoA protein using computational docking.\\nMETHODS: MDCK cells were exposed to Q3R and 100CCID\\nRESULTS: The expressions of cytokines in both genome and protein levels were significantly affected by Q3R treatment. It was shown that Q3R was much more effective against influenza when it was applied in co-penetration treatment. Q3R in combination with H1N1 increased caspase-3 activity while decreasing RhoA activation. The molecular docking results showed strong binding ability of Q3R with M2 transmembrane, Neuraminidase of 2009 pandemic H1N1, N1 and H1 of PR/8/1934 and Human RhoA proteins, with docking energy of -\\u200910.81, -\\u200910.47, -\\u20099.52, -\\u20099.24 and\\u2009-\\u20098.78 Kcal/mol, respectively.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside from RM was significantly effective against influenza infection by immunomodulatory properties, affecting the apoptosis pathway and binding ability to viral receptors M2 transmembrane and Neuraminidase of 2009 pandemic H1N1 and human RhoA cellular protein. Further research will focus on detecting the detailed specific mechanism of Q3R in virus-host interactions.', '31757810': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) effectively manipulates host machinery to replicate. There is a growing evidence that an optimal acetylation environment in the host cell is favorable to IAV proliferation and vice versa. The histone deacetylases (HDACs), a family of 18 host enzymes classified into four classes, are central to negatively regulating the acetylation level, hence the HDACs would not be favorable to IAV. Indeed, by using the RNAi and overexpression strategies, we found that human HDAC4, a class II member, possesses anti-IAV properties and is a component of host innate antiviral response. We discovered that IAV multiplication was augmented in HDAC4-depleted cells and abated in HDAC4-supplemented cells. Likewise, the expression of IFITM3, ISG15, and viperin, some of the critical markers of host anti-IAV response was abated in HDAC4-depleted cells and augmented in HDAC4-supplemented cells. In turn, IAV strongly antagonizes the HDAC4, by down-regulating its expression both at the mRNA level via viral RNA endonuclease PA-X and at the polypeptide level by inducing its cleavage via host caspase 3 in infected cells. Such HDAC4 polypeptide cleavage resulted in a ∼30 kDa fragment that is also observed in some heterologous systems and may have a significant role in IAV replication.', '31653718': 'The respiratory epithelium is exposed to the environment and initiates inflammatory responses to exclude pathogens. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection triggers inflammatory responses in the respiratory mucosa, but the mechanisms of inflammasome activation are poorly understood. We identified MxA as a functional inflammasome sensor in respiratory epithelial cells that recognizes IAV nucleoprotein and triggers the formation of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) specks via interaction of its GTPase domain with the PYD domain of ASC. ASC specks were present in bronchiolar epithelial cells of IAV-infected MxA-transgenic mice, which correlated with early IL-1β production and early recruitment of granulocytes in the lungs of infected mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that MxA contributes to IAV resistance by triggering a rapid inflammatory response in infected respiratory epithelial cells.', '31329089': 'Influenza A viruses (IAVs) enter into cells by receptor-dependent endocytosis. Subsequently, conformational changes of haemagglutinin are triggered by low environmental pH and the N terminus of HA2 glycoprotein (gp) is inserted into the endosomal membrane, resulting in fusion pore formation and genomic vRNA release into the cytoplasm. However, the pH optimum of membrane fusion is host- and virus-specific and can have an impact on virus pathogenicity. We prepared mutants of neurotropic IAV A/WSN/33 (H1N1) with aa substitutions in HA2 gp at the site of HA1/HA2 interaction, namely T64', '31181126': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) neuraminidase (NA) receptor-destroying activity and hemagglutinin (HA) receptor-binding affinity need to be balanced with the host receptor repertoire for optimal viral fitness. NAs of avian, but not human viruses, contain a functional 2nd sialic acid (SIA)-binding site (2SBS) adjacent to the catalytic site, which contributes to sialidase activity against multivalent substrates. The receptor-binding specificity and potentially crucial contribution of the 2SBS to the HA-NA balance of virus particles is, however, poorly characterized. Here, we elucidated the receptor-binding specificity of the 2SBS of N2 NA and established an important role for this site in the virion HA-NA-receptor balance. NAs of H2N2/1957 pandemic virus with or without a functional 2SBS and viruses containing this NA were analysed. Avian-like N2, with a restored 2SBS due to an amino acid substitution at position 367, was more active than human N2 on multivalent substrates containing α2,3-linked SIAs, corresponding with the pronounced binding-specificity of avian-like N2 for these receptors. When introduced into human viruses, avian-like N2 gave rise to altered plaque morphology and decreased replication compared to human N2. An opposite replication phenotype was observed when N2 was combined with avian-like HA. Specific bio-layer interferometry assays revealed a clear effect of the 2SBS on the dynamic interaction of virus particles with receptors. The absence or presence of a functional 2SBS affected virion-receptor binding and receptor cleavage required for particle movement on a receptor-coated surface and subsequent NA-dependent self-elution. The contribution of the 2SBS to virus-receptor interactions depended on the receptor-binding properties of HA and the identity of the receptors used. We conclude that the 2SBS is an important and underappreciated determinant of the HA-NA-receptor balance. The rapid loss of a functional 2SBS in pandemic viruses may have served to balance the novel host receptor-repertoire and altered receptor-binding properties of the corresponding HA protein.', '31110357': 'The upper respiratory tract is continuously exposed to a vast array of potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria. Influenza A virus (IAV) has particular synergism with the commensal bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae in this niche, and co-infection exacerbates pathogenicity and causes significant mortality. However, it is not known whether this synergism is associated with a direct interaction between the two pathogens. We have previously reported that co-administration of a whole-inactivated IAV vaccine (γ-Flu) with a whole-inactivated pneumococcal vaccine (γ-PN) enhances pneumococcal-specific responses. In this study, we show that mucosal co-administration of γ-Flu and γ-PN similarly augments IAV-specific immunity, particularly tissue-resident memory cell responses in the lung. In addition, our in vitro analysis revealed that S. pneumoniae directly interacts with both γ-Flu and with live IAV, facilitating increased uptake by macrophages as well as increased infection of epithelial cells by IAV. These observations provide an additional explanation for the synergistic pathogenicity of IAV and S. pneumoniae, as well as heralding the prospect of exploiting the phenomenon to develop better vaccine strategies for both pathogens.', '31015836': 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are evolutionarily successful pathogens, capable of infecting a number of avian and mammalian species and responsible for pandemic and seasonal epidemic disease in humans. To infect new species, IAV typically must overcome a number of species barriers to entry, replication, and egress, even while virus replication is counteracted by antiviral host factors and innate immune mechanisms. A number of host factors have been found to regulate the replication of IAV by interacting with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The host factor PARP1, a poly-ADP ribosyl polymerase, was required for optimal functions of human, swine, and avian influenza RdRP in human 293T cells. In IAV infection, PARP1 was required for efficient synthesis of viral nucleoprotein (NP) in human lung A549 cells. Intriguingly, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity (PARylation) by 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide led to a 4-fold increase in RdRP activity, and a 2.3-fold increase in virus titer. Exogenous expression of the natural PARylation inhibitor PARG also enhanced RdRP activity. These data suggest a virus-host interaction dynamic where PARP1 protein itself is required, but cellular PARylation has a distinct suppressive modality, on influenza A viral polymerase activity in human cells.', '30873142': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a worldwide ongoing health threat causing diseases in both humans and animals. The interaction between IAV and host is a dynamic and evolving process that influences the pathogenicity and host specificity of the virus. TRIM14, a member of tripartite motif (TRIM) family, has been demonstrated to possess a strong capability of regulating type I interferon and NF-κB induction in host defense against viral infection. In this study, we found that TRIM14 could restrict the replication of IAV in a type I interferon and NF-κB independent manner. Mechanistically, different domains of TRIM14 could selectively interact with the viral nucleoprotein (NP), resulting in disparate influences on the RNP formation and viral replication. In particular, the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM14 exhibited a potent inhibitory activity on NP protein stability and IAV replication. On the contrary, the ΔS2 domain could rather antagonize the function of PRYSPRY domain and promote the IAV RNP formation by stabilizing NP. At the biochemical level, TRIM14-NP interaction could induce the K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NP. Moreover, due to the rapid degradation of newly synthesized NP, TRIM14 could effectively block the translocation of NP from cytoplasm to nucleus thus further restrain the propagation of IAV in host cells. Taken together, our study has unraveled a previously unknown mechanism of TRIM14 mediated inhibition on RNP formation and influenza virus replication, and provides a new paradigm of complex and multifaceted host-pathogen interaction between ISG and viral protein.', '30651364': 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are known to modulate and \"hijack\" several cellular host mechanisms, including gene splicing and RNA maturation machineries. These modulations alter host cellular responses and enable an optimal expression of viral products throughout infection.

However, it remains unknown whether alternatively spliced isoforms of p53, known to modulate p53 transcriptional activity, are affected by IAV infection and contribute to IAV replication. Using a ', '30541828': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) infection could induce autophagosome accumulation. However, the impact of the autophagy machinery on IAV infection remains controversial. Here, we showed that induction of cellular autophagy by starvation or rapamycin treatment increases progeny virus production, while disruption of autophagy using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) and pharmacological inhibitor reduces progeny virus production. Further studies revealed that alteration of autophagy significantly affects the early stages of the virus life cycle or viral RNA synthesis. Importantly, we demonstrated that overexpression of both the IAV M2 and NP proteins alone leads to the lipidation of LC3 to LC3-II and a redistribution of LC3 from the cytosol to punctate vesicles indicative of authentic autophagosomes. Intriguingly, both M2 and NP colocalize and interact with LC3 puncta during M2 or NP transfection alone and IAV infection, leading to an increase in viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) export and infectious viral particle formation, which indicates that the IAV-host autophagy interaction plays a critical role in regulating IAV replication. We showed that NP and M2 induce the AKT-mTOR-dependent autophagy pathway and an increase in HSP90AA1 expression. Finally, our studies provided evidence that IAV replication needs an autophagy pathway to enhance viral RNA synthesis via the interaction of PB2 and HSP90AA1 by modulating HSP90AA1 expression and the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in host cells.

Influenza A virus (IAV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both infect the tissues of the respiratory tract, and as such we hypothesize that they might require similar host factors. Several published genome-wide screens have identified putative IAV host factors; however, there is significant discordance between their hits. In order to build on this work, we integrated a variety of \"OMICS\" data sources using two complementary network analyses, yielding 51 genes enriched for both IAV and RSV replication. We designed a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based assay to screen these genes against IAV under robust conditions and identified 13 genes supported by two IAV subtypes in both primary and transformed human lung cells. One of these hits, RNA binding motif 14 (RBM14), was validated as a required host factor and furthermore was shown to relocalize to the nucleolus upon IAV infection but not with other viruses. Additionally, the IAV NS1 protein is both necessary and sufficient for RBM14 relocalization, and relocalization also requires the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding capacity of NS1.

In general, the role of virally encapsidated host cell proteins in the viral life cycle is unclear. The virion contains abundant ubiquitin molecules some of which have been identified as unanchored polyubiquitin chains. These ubiquitin chains have been postulated to play a role in recruiting histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) to the cytosolic surface of late endosomes (LEs), promoting IAV uncoating via aggresome processing-a cellular machinery that disposes of protein waste. HDAC6, a class II HDAC, is unusual because it resides mostly in the cytosol instead of the nucleus. It is a unique protein consisting of two catalytic domains (CDs) and a zinc-finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF-UBP) close to its C-terminus. This ZnF-UBP recognizes the unconjugated ubiquitin C-terminus (di-Gly motif) with very high affinity. Biochemical analyses showed that free di-Gly motifs are present in the form of unanchored ubiquitin inside IAV virions. These motifs are exposed following low pH-triggered viral fusion at the LEs and attract HDAC6 transiently to the cytosolic surface of vesicles. The binding of the two components promotes viral uncoating via HDAC6 interaction with cellular motor proteins dynein and myosin II and the viral M1 capsid. The cellular mechanism involved is related to aggresome processing, a pathway that promotes degradation of misfolded protein aggregates. K63-linked ubiquitin chains are thought to be the trigger for aggresome processing, though it is still not clear whether such types of chains are prevalent within the IAV capsid. Here, we present methods using purified ZnF-UBP domain of HDAC6 to immunoprecipitate viral unanchored ubiquitin chains, which can then be used for further biochemical analyses of ubiquitin chain linkage.', '29899090': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly transmissible respiratory pathogen and a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world.

However, the role of TRIM41 in IAV infection is unknown. Here, we report that TRIM41 interacts with NP through its SPRY domain. Furthermore, TRIM41 is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells, and overexpression of TRIM41 inhibits IAV infection.

Here, we profiled the cellular miRNAs of A549 cells infected with A/goose/Jilin/hb/2003 (H5N1) and a comparison A/Beijing/501/2009 (H1N1). miRNA microarray and quantitative PCR analysis showed that several miRNAs were differentially expressed in A549 cells during IAV infection. Subsequently, we demonstrated that IAV replication was essential for the regulation of these miRNAs, and bioinformatic analysis revealed that the targets of these miRNAs affected biological processes relevant to IAV replication. Specifically, miR-21-3p was found to be down-regulated in IAV-infected A549 cells and selected for further detailed analysis. Target prediction and functional study illustrated that miR-21-3p repressed the expression of HDAC8 by targeting its 3'UTR. Furthermore, we confirmed miR-21-3p could promote virus replication, which was similar to the result of knocking down HDAC8, indicating that miR-21-3p promoted IAV replication by suppressing HDAC8 expression.

Currently, there are a few in vitro models available to study IAV immunopathology. Monolayer cultures of cell lines and primary lung cells (two-dimensional [2D] cell culture) is the most commonly used tool, however, this system does not have the in vivo-like structure of the lung and immune responses to IAV as it lacks the three-dimensional (3D) tissue structure. To recapitulate the lung physiology in vitro, a system that contains multiple cell types within a 3D environment that allows cell movement and interaction would provide a critical tool. In this study, as a first step in designing a 3D-Human Tissue-Engineered Lung Model (3D-HTLM), we describe the 3D culture of primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEpCs) and determined the immunophenotype of this system in response to IAV infections. We constructed a 3D chitosan-collagen scaffold and cultured HSAEpCs on these scaffolds at air-liquid interface (ALI). These 3D cultures were compared with 2D-cultured HSAEpCs for viability, morphology, marker protein expression, and cell differentiation. Results showed that the 3D-cultured HSAEpCs at ALI yielded maximum viable cells and morphologically resembled the in vivo lower airway epithelium. There were also significant increases in aquaporin-5 and cytokeratin-14 expression for HSAEpCs cultured in 3D compared to 2D. The 3D culture system was used to study the infection of HSAEpCs with two major IAV strains, H1N1 and H3N2. The HSAEpCs showed distinct changes in marker protein expression, both at mRNA and protein levels, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. This study is the first step in the development of the 3D-HTLM, which will have wide applicability in studying pulmonary pathophysiology and therapeutics development.', '29624498': 'Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can cause zoonotic infections with pandemic potential when most of the human population is immunologically naive. After a pandemic, IAVs evolve to become seasonal in the human host by acquiring adaptive mutations. We have previously reported that the interferon (IFN)-inducible tripartite motif 22 (TRIM22) protein restricts the replication of seasonal IAVs by direct interaction with the viral nucleoprotein (NP), leading to its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Here we show that, in contrast to seasonal H1N1 IAVs, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain as well as H1N1 strains from the 1930s are resistant to TRIM22 restriction. We demonstrate that arginine-to-lysine substitutions conferring an increased sensitivity to TRIM22-dependent ubiquitination accumulated progressively in the NP of seasonal influenza A (H1N1) viruses between 1918 and 2009.

The processes and mechanisms that result in IAV mammalian adaptation are poorly understood. The viral nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein counteracts the interferon (IFN) response, a central component of the host species barrier. We characterized the NS1 proteins of equine influenza virus (EIV), a mammalian IAV lineage of avian origin. We showed that evolutionarily distinct NS1 proteins counteract the IFN response using different and mutually exclusive mechanisms: while the NS1 proteins of early EIVs block general gene expression by binding to cellular polyadenylation-specific factor 30 (CPSF30), NS1 proteins from more evolved EIVs specifically block the induction of IFN-stimulated genes by interfering with the JAK/STAT pathway. These contrasting anti-IFN strategies are associated with two mutations that appeared sequentially and were rapidly selected for during EIV evolution, highlighting the importance of evolutionary processes in immune evasion mechanisms during IAV adaptation.', '28768860': \"Influenza A virus (IAV) replication relies on an intricate interaction between virus and host cells. How the cellular proteins are usurped for IAV replication remains largely obscure. The aim of this study was to search for novel and potential cellular factors that participate in IAV replication. ZBTB25, a transcription repressor of a variety of cellular genes, was identified by an RNA interference (RNAi) genomic library screen. Depletion of ZBTB25 significantly reduced IAV production. Conversely, overexpression of ZBTB25 enhanced it. ZBTB25 interacted with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein and modulated its transcription activity. In addition, ZBTB25 also functioned as a viral RNA (vRNA)-binding protein, binding preferentially to the U-rich sequence within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of vRNA. Both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions involving ZBTB25 facilitated viral RNA transcription and replication. In addition, ZBTB25 suppressed interferon production, further enhancing viral replication. ZBTB25-associated functions required an intact zinc finger domain and posttranslational SUMO-1 modification of ZBTB25. Furthermore, treatment with disulfiram (a zinc ejector) of ZBTB25-overexpressing cells showed significantly reduced IAV production as a result of reduced RNA synthesis.

Influenza A virus (IAV) is able to get past the first line of defense. Elucidation of the molecular interaction between influenza factors and the newly recognized host players in the innate response might help in our understanding of the root causes of virulence and pathogenicity of IAV. In this study, we show that expression of miR-26a leads to a significant inhibition of IAV replication. miR-26a does not directly target IAV genome. Instead, miR-26a activates the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway and promotes the production of IFN-stimulated genes, thus suppressing viral replication. Furthermore, ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3), a negative regulator of type I IFN pathway, is targeted by miR-26a upon IAV challenge. However, miR-26a is significantly downregulated during IAV infection. Thus, downregulation of miR-26a is a new strategy evolved by IAV to counteract cellular antiviral responses.

We found that the levels of viral RNA, protein, viral particles, and RNA polymerase activity in CNOT4 knockdown cells were lower than those in the control cells upon IAV infection.

Recently, it has been recognized that these ncRNAs are critically implicated in the virus-host interaction as key regulators of transcription or post-transcription during viral infection. Influenza A virus (IAV) is still a major threat to human health. Hundreds of ncRNAs are differentially expressed in response to infection with IAV, such as infection by pandemic H1N1 and highly pathogenic avian strains. There is increasing evidence demonstrating functional involvement of these regulatory microRNAs, vault RNAs (vtRNAs) and lncRNAs in pathogenesis of influenza virus, including a variety of host immune responses. For example, it has been shown that ncRNAs regulate activation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-associated signaling and transcription factors (nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, NF-κB), as well as production of interferons (IFNs) and cytokines, and expression of critical IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The vital functions of IAV-regulated ncRNAs either to against defend viral invasion or to promote progeny viron production are summarized in this review.

Developing more effective virus control modalities requires better understanding of virus-host interactions. It has previously been shown that IAV induces the production of kynurenine, which suppresses T-cell responses, enhances pain hypersensitivity and disturbs behaviour in infected animals. However, the regulation of kynurenine biosynthesis during IAV infection remains elusive. Here we showed that IAV infection induced expression of interferons (IFNs), which upregulated production of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), which catalysed the kynurenine biosynthesis. Furthermore, IAV attenuated the IDO1 expression and the production of kynurenine through its NS1 protein. Interestingly, inhibition of viral replication prior to IFN induction limited IDO1 expression, while inhibition after did not. Finally, we showed that kynurenine biosynthesis was activated in macrophages in response to other stimuli, such as influenza B virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Thus, the tight regulation of the kynurenine biosynthesis by host cell and, perhaps, pathogen might be a basic signature of a wide range of host-pathogen interactions, which should be taken into account during development of novel antiviral and antibacterial drugs.', '27795429': 'None: Influenza A virus (IAV) matrix protein 2 (M2) plays multiple roles in the early and late phases of viral infection. Once synthesized, M2 is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), travels to the Golgi apparatus, and is sorted at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for transport to the apical plasma membrane, where it functions in virus budding. We hypothesized that M2 trafficking along with its secretory pathway must be finely regulated, and host factors could be involved in this process. However, no studies examining the role of host factors in M2 posttranslational transport have been reported. Here, we used a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to screen for host proteins that interact with the M2 protein and identified transport protein particle complex 6A (TRAPPC6A) as a potential binding partner. We found that both TRAPPC6A and its N-terminal internal-deletion isoform, TRAPPC6A delta (TRAPPC6AΔ), interact with M2. Truncation and mutation analyses showed that the highly conserved leucine residue at position 96 of M2 is critical for mediating this interaction. The role of TRAPPC6AΔ in the viral life cycle was investigated by the knockdown of endogenous TRAPPC6AΔ with small interfering RNA (siRNA) and by generating a recombinant virus that was unable to interact with TRAPPC6A/TRAPPC6AΔ. The results indicated that TRAPPC6AΔ, through its interaction with M2, slows M2 trafficking to the apical plasma membrane, favors viral replication in vitro, and positively modulates virus virulence in mice.\\nIMPORTANCE: The influenza A virus M2 protein regulates the trafficking of not only other proteins but also itself along the secretory pathway. However, the host factors involved in the regulation of the posttranslational transport of M2 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified TRAPPC6A and its N-terminal internal-deletion isoform, TRAPPC6AΔ, as interacting partners of M2. We found that the leucine (L) residue at position 96 of M2 is critical for mediating this interaction, which leads us to propose that the high level of conservation of 96L is a consequence of M2 adaptation to its interacting host factor TRAPPC6A/TRAPPC6AΔ. Importantly, we discovered that TRAPPC6AΔ can positively regulate viral replication in vitro by modulating M2 trafficking to the plasma membrane.', '27265461': 'Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause acute respiratory infections of humans, which are repeated yearly. Human IAV infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and therefore they represent a serious health problem. All human IAV strains are originally derived from avian IAVs, which, after their adaptation to humans, can spread in the human population and cause pandemics with more or less severe course of the disease. Presently, however, the potential of avian IAV to infect humans and to cause the disease cannot be predicted. Many studies are therefore focused on factors influencing the virulence and pathogenicity of IAV viruses in a given host. The virus-host interaction starts by virus attachment via the envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) to the receptors on the cell surface. In addition to receptor binding, HA mediates also the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, which follows the virus endocytosis. The fusion potential of HA trimer, primed by proteolytic cleavage, is activated by low pH in endosomes, resulting in HA refolding into the fusion-active form. The HA conformation change is predetermined by its 3-D structure, is pH-dependent, irreversible and strain-specific. The process of fusion activation of IAV hemagglutinin is crucial for virus entry into the cell and for the ability of the virus to replicate in the host.

To answer to this question, we analysed immuno-modulating properties of the antivirals saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe), SNS-032, obatoclax, and gemcitabine, and found that only gemcitabine did not impair immune responses in infected cells. It also allowed activation of innate immune responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and interferon alpha (IFNα)-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, immuno-mediators produced by gemcitabine-treated IAV-infected macrophages were able to prime immune responses in non-infected cells.

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the IFN reaction are incompletely understood, as previous studies investigated mainly the population responses of virus-infected cultures, although substantial cell-to-cell variability has been documented. We devised a fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based assay to simultaneously quantify expression of viral antigens and ISGs, such as ISG15, MxA, and IFIT1, in IAV-infected cell cultures at the single-cell level. This approach revealed that seasonal IAV triggers an unexpected asymmetric response, as the major cell populations expressed either viral antigen or ISG, but rarely both. Further investigations identified a role of the viral NS1 protein in blocking ISG expression in infected cells, which surprisingly did not reduce paracrine IFN signaling to noninfected cells. Interestingly, viral ISG control was impaired in cultures infected with avian-origin IAV, including the H7N9 virus from eastern China. This phenotype was traced back to polymorphic NS1 amino acids known to be important for stable binding of the polyadenylation factor CPSF30 and concomitant suppression of host cell gene expression. Most significantly, mutation of two amino acids within the CPSF30 attachment site of NS1 from seasonal IAV diminished the strict control of ISG expression in infected cells and substantially attenuated virus replication. In conclusion, our approach revealed an asymmetric, NS1-dependent ISG induction in cultures infected with seasonal IAV, which appears to be essential for efficient virus propagation.\\nIMPORTANCE: Interferons are expressed by infected cells in response to IAV infection and play important roles in the antiviral immune response by inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Unlike many previous studies, we investigated the ISG response at the single-cell level, enabling novel insights into this virus-host interaction. Hence, cell cultures infected with seasonal IAV displayed an asymmetric ISG induction that was confined almost exclusively to noninfected cells. In comparison, ISG expression was observed in larger cell populations infected with avian-origin IAV, suggesting a more resolute antiviral response to these strains. Strict control of ISG expression by seasonal IAV was explained by the binding of the viral NS1 protein to the polyadenylation factor CPSF30, which reduces host cell gene expression. Mutational disruption of CPSF30 binding within NS1 concomitantly attenuated ISG control and replication of seasonal IAV, illustrating the importance of maintaining an asymmetric ISG response for efficient virus propagation.', '25547032': 'BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important pathogens that affect the health of humans and many additional animal species.

Understanding how IAVs interact with host proteins is essential for elucidating all of the required processes for viral replication, restrictions in species host range, and potential targets for antiviral therapies.\\nMETHODS: In this study, the NP from a swine IAV was cloned into a yeast two-hybrid \"bait\" vector for expression of a yeast Gal4 binding domain (BD)-NP fusion protein. This \"bait\" was used to screen a Y2H human HeLa cell \"prey\" library which consisted of human proteins fused to the Gal4 protein\\'s activation domain (AD). The interaction of \"bait\" and \"prey\" proteins resulted in activation of reporter genes.\\nRESULTS: Seventeen positive bait-prey interactions were isolated in yeast. All of the \"prey\" isolated also interact in yeast with a NP \"bait\" cloned from a human IAV strain. Isolation and sequence analysis of the cDNAs encoding the human prey proteins revealed ten different human proteins. These host proteins are involved in various host cell processes and structures, including purine biosynthesis (PAICS), metabolism (ACOT13), proteasome (PA28B), DNA-binding (MSANTD3), cytoskeleton (CKAP5), potassium channel formation (KCTD9), zinc transporter function (SLC30A9), Na+/K+ ATPase function (ATP1B1), and RNA splicing (TRA2B).\\nCONCLUSIONS: Ten human proteins were identified as interacting with IAV NP in a Y2H screen. Some of these human proteins were reported in previous screens aimed at elucidating host proteins relevant to specific viral life cycle processes such as replication. This study extends previous findings by suggesting a mechanism by which these host proteins associate with the IAV, i.e., physical interaction with NP. Furthermore, this study revealed novel host protein-NP interactions in yeast.', '25320310': 'UNLABELLED: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) rely on host factors to support their life cycle, as viral proteins hijack or interact with cellular proteins to execute their functions. Identification and understanding of these factors would increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms manipulated by the viruses. In this study, we searched for novel binding partners of the influenza A virus NS2 protein, the nuclear export protein responsible for overcoming host range restriction, by a yeast two-hybrid screening assay and glutathione S-transferase-pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays and identified AIMP2, a potent tumor suppressor that usually functions to regulate protein stability, as one of the major NS2-binding candidates. We found that the presence of NS2 protected AIMP2 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation in NS2-transfected cells and AIMP2 functioned as a positive regulator of IAV replication. Interestingly, AIMP2 had no significant effect on NS2 but enhanced the stability of the matrix protein M1. Further, we provide evidence that AIMP2 recruitment switches the modification of M1 from ubiquitination to SUMOylation, which occurs on the same attachment site (K242) on M1 and thereby promotes M1-mediated viral ribonucleoprotein complex nuclear export to increase viral replication. Collectively, our results reveal a new mechanism of AIMP2 mediation of influenza virus replication.\\nIMPORTANCE: Although the ubiquitination of M1 during IAV infection has been observed, the precise modification site and the molecular consequences of this modification remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that ubiquitin and SUMO compete for the same lysine (K242) on M1 and the interaction of NS2 with AIMP2 facilitates the switch of the M1 modification from ubiquitination to SUMOylation, thus increasing viral replication.', '25031340': 'UNLABELLED: Influenza A virus (IAV) entry is a multistep process that requires the interaction of the virus with numerous host factors. In this study, we demonstrate that prolidase (PEPD) is a cellular factor required by IAV for successful entry into target cells. PEPD was selected as a candidate during an entry screen performed on nonvalidated primary hits from previously published genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens. siRNA-mediated depletion of PEPD resulted in the decreased growth of IAV during mono- and multicycle growth. This growth defect was independent of cell type or virus strain. Furthermore, IAV restriction was apparent as early as 3 h postinfection, and experiments in the absence of protein biosynthesis revealed that the nuclear import of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) was already blocked in the absence of PEPD. These results led us to investigate which step during entry was affected. Receptor expression, IAV attachment, or IAV internalization was not dependent on the presence of PEPD. However, when looking at the distribution of incoming IAV particles in PEPD-knockdown cells, we found a localization pattern that differed from that in control cells: IAV mostly localized to the cell periphery, and consequently, viral particles displayed reduced colocalization with early and late endosome markers and fusion between viral and endosomal membranes was strongly reduced. Finally, experiments using a competitive inhibitor of PEPD catalytic activity suggested that the enzymatic function of the dipeptidase is required for its proviral effect on IAV entry. In sum, this study establishes PEPD as a novel entry factor required for early endosomal trafficking of IAV.\\nIMPORTANCE: Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a constant threat to public health. As IAV relies on its host cell for replication, the identification of host factors required by the virus is of importance. First, such studies often reveal novel functions of cellular factors and can extend our knowledge of cellular processes. Second, we can further our understanding of processes that are required for the entry of IAV into target cells. Third, the identification of host factors that contribute to IAV entry will increase the number of potential targets for the development of novel antiviral drugs that are of urgent need. Our study identifies prolidase (PEPD) to be a novel entry factor required by IAV for correct routing within the endosomal compartment following virus internalization. Thereby, we link PEPD, which has been shown to play a role during collagen recycling and growth factor signaling, to early events of viral infection.', '24899174': 'UNLABELLED: Influenza A virus (IAV) replication depends on the interaction of virus proteins with host factors. The viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is essential in this process by targeting diverse cellular functions, including mRNA splicing and translation, cell survival, and immune defense, in particular the type I interferon (IFN-I) response. In order to identify host proteins targeted by NS1, we established a replication-competent recombinant IAV that expresses epitope-tagged forms of NS1 and NS2, which are encoded by the same gene segment, allowing purification of NS proteins during natural cell infection and analysis of interacting proteins by quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified known NS1- and NS2-interacting proteins but also uncharacterized proteins, including PACT, an important cofactor for the IFN-I response triggered by the viral RNA-sensor RIG-I. We show here that NS1 binds PACT during virus replication and blocks PACT/RIG-I-mediated activation of IFN-I, which represents a critical event for the host defense. Protein interaction and interference with IFN-I activation depended on the functional integrity of the highly conserved RNA binding domain of NS1. A mutant virus with deletion of NS1 induced high levels of IFN-I in control cells, as expected; in contrast, shRNA-mediated knockdown of PACT compromised IFN-I activation by the mutant virus, but not wild-type virus, a finding consistent with the interpretation that PACT (i) is essential for IAV recognition and (ii) is functionally compromised by NS1. Together, our data describe a novel approach to identify virus-host protein interactions and demonstrate that NS1 interferes with PACT, whose function is critical for robust IFN-I production.\\nIMPORTANCE: Influenza A virus (IAV) is an important human pathogen that is responsible for annual epidemics and occasional devastating pandemics. Viral replication and pathogenicity depends on the interference of viral factors with components of the host defense system, particularly the type I interferon (IFN-I) response. The viral NS1 protein is known to counteract virus recognition and IFN-I production, but the molecular mechanism is only partially defined. We used a novel proteomic approach to identify host proteins that are bound by NS1 during virus replication and identified the protein PACT, which had previously been shown to be involved in virus-mediated IFN-I activation. We find that NS1 prevents PACT from interacting with an essential component of the virus recognition pathway, RIG-I, thereby disabling efficient IFN-I production. These observations provide an important piece of information on how IAV efficiently counteracts the host immune defense.', '24802111': 'Influenza A virus (IAV), similar to other viruses, exploits the machinery of human host cells for its survival and replication. We identified α-actinin-4, a host cytoskeletal protein, as an interacting partner of IAV nucleoprotein (NP). We confirmed this interaction using co-immunoprecipitation studies, first in a coupled in vitro transcription-translation assay and then in cells either transiently co-expressing the two proteins or infected with whole IAV. Importantly, the NP-actinin-4 interaction was observed in several IAV subtypes, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies revealed that both NP and actinin-4 co-localized largely around the nucleus and also in the cytoplasmic region of virus-infected A549 cells. Silencing of actinin-4 expression resulted in not only a significant decrease in NP, M2 and NS1 viral protein expression, but also a reduction of both NP mRNA and viral RNA levels, as well as viral titers, 24 h post-infection with IAV, suggesting that actinin-4 was critical for viral replication. Furthermore, actinin-4 depletion reduced the amount of NP localized in the nucleus. Treatment of infected cells with wortmannin, a known inhibitor of actinin-4, led to a decrease in NP mRNA levels and also caused the nuclear retention of NP, further strengthening our previous observations. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that actinin-4, a novel interacting partner of IAV NP, plays a crucial role in viral replication and this interaction may participate in nuclear localization of NP and/or viral ribonucleoproteins.', '24261589': 'BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) neuraminidase (NA) cleaves sialic acids (Sias) from glycans. Inhibiting NA with oseltamivir suppresses both viral infection, and viral release from cultured human airway epithelial cells. The role of NA in viral exit is well established: it releases budding virions by cleaving Sias from glycoconjugates on infected cells and progeny virions. The role of NA in viral entry remains unclear. Host respiratory epithelia secrete a mucus layer rich in heavily sialylated glycoproteins; these could inhibit viral entry by mimicking sialylated receptors on the cell surface. It has been suggested that NA allows influenza to penetrate the mucus by cleaving these sialylated decoys, but the exact mechanism is not yet established.\\nMETHODS: We tested IAV interaction with secreted mucus using frozen human trachea/bronchus tissue sections, and bead-bound purified human salivary mucins (HSM) and purified porcine submaxillary mucins (PSM). The protective effect of mucus was analyzed using MDCK cells coated with purified HSM and PSM with known Sia content. Oseltamivir was used to inhibit NA activity, and the fluorescent reporter substrate, 4MU-Neu5Ac, was used to quantify NA activity.\\nRESULTS: IAV binds to the secreted mucus layer of frozen human trachea/bronchus tissues in a Sia dependent manner. HSM inhibition of IAV infection is Sia dose-dependent, but PSM cannot inhibit infection of underlying cells. HSM competitively inhibits NA cleavage of 4MU-Neu5Ac, reporter substrate. Human IAV effectively cleaves Sias from HSM but not from PSM, and binds to HSM but not to PSM.\\nCONCLUSION: IAV interacts with human mucus on frozen tissue sections and mucus-coated beads. Inhibition of IAV infection by sialylated human mucus is dose-dependent, and enhanced when NA is inhibited with oseltamivir. Thus NA cleaves sialylated decoys during initial stages of infection. Understanding IAV interactions with host mucins is a promising new avenue for drug development.', '24138989': 'BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) infection-induced inflammatory regulatory networks (IRNs) are extremely complex and dynamic. Specific biological experiments for investigating the interactions between individual inflammatory factors cannot provide a detailed and insightful multidimensional view of IRNs. Recently, data from high-throughput technologies have permitted system-level analyses. The construction of large and cell-specific IRNs from high-throughput data is essential to understanding the pathogenesis of IAV infection.\\nRESULTS: In this study, we proposed a computational method, which combines nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based optimization with mutual information, to construct a cell-specific optimized IRN during IAV infection by integrating gene expression data with a prior knowledge of network topology. Moreover, we used the average relative error and sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Furthermore, from the optimized IRN, we confirmed 45 interactions between proteins in biological experiments and identified 37 new regulatory interactions and 8 false positive interactions, including the following interactions: IL1β regulates TLR3, TLR3 regulates IFN-β and TNF regulates IL6. Most of these regulatory interactions are statistically significant by Z-statistic. The functional annotations of the optimized IRN demonstrated clearly that the defense response, immune response, response to wounding and regulation of cytokine production are the pivotal processes of IAV-induced inflammatory response. The pathway analysis results from the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) showed that 8 pathways are enriched significantly. The 5 pathways were validated by experiments, and 3 other pathways, including the intestinal immune network for IgA production, the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and the allograft rejection pathway, are the predicted novel pathways involved in the inflammatory response.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Integration of knowledge-driven and data-driven methods allows us to construct an effective IRN during IAV infection. Based on the constructed network, we have identified new interactions among inflammatory factors and biological pathways. These findings provide new insight into our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in the inflammatory network in response to IAV infection. Further characterization and experimental validation of the interaction mechanisms identified from this study may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy for the control of infections and inflammatory responses.', '23592984': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) triggers a contagious and potentially lethal respiratory disease. A protective IL-1β response is mediated by innate receptors in macrophages and lung epithelial cells. NLRP3 is crucial in macrophages; however, which sensors elicit IL-1β secretion in lung epithelial cells remains undetermined. Here, we describe for the first time the relative roles of the host innate receptors RIG-I (DDX58), TLR3, and NLRP3 in the IL-1β response to IAV in primary lung epithelial cells. To activate IL-1β secretion, these cells employ partially redundant recognition mechanisms that differ from those described in macrophages. RIG-I had the strongest effect through a MAVS/TRIM25/Riplet-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway upstream of TLR3 and NLRP3. Notably, RIG-I also activated the inflammasome through interaction with caspase 1 and ASC in primary lung epithelial cells. Thus, NS1, an influenza virulence factor that inhibits the RIG-I/type I IFN pathway, strongly modulated the IL-1β response in lung epithelial cells and in ferrets. The NS1 protein derived from a highly pathogenic strain resulted in increased interaction with RIG-I and inhibited type I IFN and IL-1β responses compared to the least pathogenic virus strains. These findings demonstrate that in IAV-infected lung epithelial cells RIG-I activates the inflammasome both directly and through a type I IFN positive feedback loop.', '23391661': 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) cause respiratory tract infections annually associated with excess mortality and morbidity. Nonspecific, innate immune mechanisms play a key role in protection against viral invasion at early stages of infection. A soluble protein present in mucosal secretions of the lung, surfactant protein D (SP-D), is an important component of this initial barrier that helps to prevent and limit IAV infections of the respiratory epithelium. This collagenous C-type lectin binds IAVs and thereby inhibits attachment and entry of the virus but also contributes to enhanced clearance of SP-D-opsonized virus via interactions with phagocytic cells. In addition, SP-D modulates the inflammatory response and helps to maintain a balance between effective neutralization/killing of IAV, and protection against alveolar damage resulting from IAV-induced excessive inflammatory responses. The mechanisms of interaction between SP-D and IAV not only depend on the structure and binding properties of SP-D but also on strain-specific features of IAV, and both issues will be discussed. SP-D from pigs exhibits distinct anti-IAV properties and is discussed in more detail. Finally, the potential of SP-D as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic antiviral agent to protect humans against infections by IAV is discussed.', '22745253': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to variable and imperfectly understood pathogenicity. We report that segment 3 of the virus contains a second open reading frame (\"X-ORF\"), accessed via ribosomal frameshifting. The frameshift product, termed PA-X, comprises the endonuclease domain of the viral PA protein with a C-terminal domain encoded by the X-ORF and functions to repress cellular gene expression. PA-X also modulates IAV virulence in a mouse infection model, acting to decrease pathogenicity. Loss of PA-X expression leads to changes in the kinetics of the global host response, which notably includes increases in inflammatory, apoptotic, and T lymphocyte-signaling pathways. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown IAV protein that modulates the host response to infection, a finding with important implications for understanding IAV pathogenesis.', '21698289': 'BACKGROUND: Double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a key regulator of the anti-viral innate immune response in mammalian cells. PKR activity is regulated by a 58 kilo Dalton cellular inhibitor (P58(IPK)), which is present in inactive state as a complex with Hsp40 under normal conditions. In case of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, P58(IPK) is known to dissociate from Hsp40 and inhibit PKR activation. However the influenza virus component responsible for PKR inhibition through P58(IPK) activation was hitherto unknown.\\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Human heat shock 40 protein (Hsp40) was identified as an interacting partner of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (IAV NP) using a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies from mammalian cells transfected with IAV NP expressing plasmid. Further, the IAV NP-Hsp40 interaction was validated in mammalian cells infected with various seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza viruses. Cellular localization studies showed that NP and Hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus. During IAV infection in mammalian cells, expression of NP coincided with the dissociation of P58(IPK) from Hsp40 and decrease PKR phosphorylation. We observed that, plasmid based expression of NP in mammalian cells leads to decrease in PKR phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of NP expression during influenza virus replication led to PKR activation and concomitant increase in eIF2α phosphorylation. Inhibition of NP expression also led to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation, enhanced IFN β production and concomitant reduction of virus replication. Taken together our data suggest that NP is the viral factor responsible for P58(IPK) activation and subsequent inhibition of PKR-mediated host response during IAV infection.\\nSIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate a novel role of IAV NP in inhibiting PKR-mediated anti-viral host response and help us understand P58(IPK) mediated inhibition of PKR activity during IAV infection.', '21434704': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) PB1-F2 protein is encoded by an alternative reading frame (+1) within the PB1 gene. PB1-F2 has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection as well as to the secondary bacterial infection. More recently has been shown that PB1-F2 protein may regulate a viral RNA (vRNA) polymerase activity by the interaction with PB1 protein. We proved that PB1-F2 protein increased the level of expression of PB1 protein and vRNA in the infected cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that a higher level of vRNA expression resulted in the increase of expression of multiple viral proteins, including NP, M1, and NS1. Finally, we used plasmids expressing N-terminal (1-50 aa) or C-terminal (51-87 aa) region of the PB1-F2 molecule for transfection of MDCK cells co-infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus deficient in the PB1-F2 protein expression (PR8ΔPB1-F2). These experiments clearly showed that N-terminal region of PB1-F2 protein was responsible for the increase in PB1 protein expression. C-terminal region of PB1-F2 protein had no effect. Thus, we have identified the important function for N-terminal region of PB1-F2 protein.', '20701360': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen whose genotypic diversity results in unpredictable pandemics and epidemics. Interaction with the cell nucleus is essential to IAV infection, allowing recruitment of cellular components to facilitate virus replication. Viral proteins are also targeted to the nucleolus, a subnuclear structure involved in ribosomal biogenesis, RNA maturation, stress response, and control of cell growth, but the functional consequences of this are unclear. We took an unbiased approach to studying IAV-nucleolar interactions by using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in conjunction with LC-MS/MS to quantify changes in the nucleolar proteome following infection with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) strains of the virus. Only a minority of nucleolar proteins showed significant changes in abundance after infection; these alterations were mostly different between the two strains but could be validated by confocal microscopy of infected cells. Many of the affected proteins comprised functional groupings, including components of ribonuclease P, RNA polymerase I, the MLL1 histone methyltransferase complex, as well as nuclear paraspeckles and the RNA editing apparatus. This, as well as comparison with other viruses that cause changes in the nucleolar proteome, suggests that IAV targets specific nucleolar pathways.', '17311557': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the most common infectious pathogens in humans. Since IVA genome does not have the processing protease for the viral membrane fusion glycoprotein precursors, entry of this virus into cells is determined primarily by host cellular, trypsin-type, processing proteases that proteolytically activate the fusion glycoprotein precursors of IAV. At least five different processing proteases have been identified in the airways of animals and humans. These proteases determine the infectious organ tropism of IAV infection as well as the efficiency of viral multiplication in the airway, and sometimes in the brain. Proteases in the upper respiratory tract are suppressed by secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, and those in the lower respiratory tract are suppressed by pulmonary surfactant which, by adsorption, inhibits the interaction between the proteases and viral membrane proteins. Since protease activities predominate over those of endogenous inhibitory compounds under normal airway conditions, administration of protease inhibitors in the early-stage of infection significantly suppresses viral entry and viral multiplication. Several viral neuraminidase inhibitors are used clinically as anti-influenza virus agents, based on their inhibitory action on viral release from infected cells. Furthermore, protease inhibitors of viral entry could be potentially useful against influenza virus as well as neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses. We also found that ambroxol, a mucolytic and anti-oxidant agent, up-regulates the levels of endogenous protease inhibitory compounds in the airway fluids in early-phase infection, and that clarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, increases IgA levels and mucosal immunity through augmentation of interleukin-12 levels in the airway. The combination of neuraminidase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, clarithromycin or ambroxol, could be potentially used as a potent anti-influenza therapy to minimize the emergence of drug-resistant mutant viruses.', '15576322': 'Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the most common infectious pathogens in humans. Entry of this virus into cells is primarily determined by host cellular trypsin-type processing proteases, which proteolytically activate viral membrane fusion glycoprotein precursors. Human IAV and murine parainfluenza virus type 1 Sendai virus are exclusively pneumotropic, and the infectious organ tropism of these viruses is determined by the susceptibility of the viral envelope glycoprotein to cleavage by proteases in the airway. Proteases in the upper respiratory tract are suppressed by secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, and those in the lower respiratory tract are suppressed by pulmonary surfactant, which by adsorption inhibits the interaction between the proteases and viral membrane proteins. Although the protease activities are predominant over the activities of inhibitory compounds under normal airway conditions, intranasal administration of inhibitors was able to significantly suppress multi-cycles of viral replication in the airway. In addition, we identified chemical agents that could act as defensive factors by up-regulating the levels of the natural inhibitors and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in airway fluids. One of these compounds, ambroxol, is a mucolytic and anti-oxidant agent that stimulates the release of secretory leukoprotease inhibitor and pulmonary surfactant in the early phase, and IgA in the late phase of infection at an optimal dose, i.e. a dose sufficient to inhibit virus proliferation and increase the survival rate of animals after treatment with a lethal dose of IAV. Another agent, clarithromycin, is a macrolide antibiotic that increases IgA levels through augmentation of interleukin-12 levels and mucosal immunization in the airway. In addition to the sialidase inhibitors, which prevent the release of IAV from infected cells, inhibitors of the processing proteases and chemical agents that augment mucosal immunity and/or levels of the relevant defensive compounds may also ultimately prove to be useful as new anti-influenza agents.'}\n",

virus-infected cells revealed that ns1 was phosphorylated at serine 205 in intermediate stages of the viral life cycle. interestingly, s205 is one of six amino acid changes in ns1 of post-pandemic h1n1 viruses currently circulating in humans compared to the original swine-origin 2009 pandemic (h1n1pdm09) virus, suggesting a role in host adaptation. to identify ns1 functions regulated by s205 phosphorylation, we generated recombinant pr8 h1n1 ns1 mutants with s205g (nonphosphorylatable) or s205n (h1n1pdm09 signature), as well as h1n1pdm09 viruses harboring the reverse mutation ns1 n205s or n205d (phosphomimetic). replication of pr8 ns1 mutants was attenuated relative to wild-type (wt) virus replication in a porcine cell line. however, pr8 ns1 s205n showed remarkably higher attenuation than pr8 ns1 s205g in a human cell line, highlighting a potential host-independent advantage of phosphorylatable s205, while an asparagine at this position led to a potential host-specific attenuation. interestingly, pr8 ns1 s205g did not show polymerase activity-enhancing functions, in contrast to the wt, which can be attributed to diminished interaction with cellular restriction factor ddx21. analysis of the respective kinase mediating s205 phosphorylation indicated an involvement of casein kinase 2 (ck2). ck2 inhibition significantly reduced the replication of wt viruses and decreased ns1-ddx21 interaction, as observed for ns1 s205g. in summary, ns1 s205 is required for efficient ns1-ddx21 binding, resulting in enhanced viral polymerase activity, which is likely to be regulated by transient phosphorylation.', '33172261': \"influenza a virus (iav) is a highly contagious human pathogen that is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year. non-structural

protein 1 (pabp1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4g. we analyzed the interaction of ns1 with pabp1 using quantitative techniques. our studies show that ns1 binds as a homodimer to pabp1, and this interaction is conserved across different iav strains. unexpectedly, ns1 does not bind to pabp1 that is bound to poly(a) rna. instead, ns1 binds only to pabp1 free of rna, suggesting that stimulation of translation does not occur by ns1 interacting with the pabp1 molecule attached to the mrna 3'-poly(a) tail. these results suggest that the function of the ns1·pabp1 complex appears to be distinct

significance of this phenomenon. by using the rna interference screens and site-directed mutagenesis followed by western blotting, we found that lysosome protease, cathepsin c is involved in cortactin degradation in human cells infected with iav. furthermore, executioner apoptotic caspase, caspase-3 not caspase-6 or caspase-7 is involved in cortactin degradation during iav infection, and caspase-3 cleavage site is located in the first actin-binding repeat of cortactin polypeptide. finally, when expressed ectopically, the cleavage-resistant cortactin mutants decreased the amount of iav progeny

hemagglutinin (ha) receptor-binding affinity need to be balanced with the host receptor repertoire for optimal viral fitness. nas of avian, but not human viruses, contain a functional 2nd sialic acid (sia)-binding site (2sbs) adjacent to the catalytic site, which contributes to sialidase activity against multivalent substrates. the receptor-binding specificity and potentially crucial contribution of the 2sbs to the ha-na balance of virus particles is, however, poorly characterized. here, we elucidated the receptor-binding specificity of the 2sbs of n2 na and established an important role for this site in the virion ha-na-receptor balance. nas of h2n2/1957 pandemic virus with or without a functional 2sbs and viruses containing this na were analysed. avian-like n2, with a restored 2sbs due to an amino acid substitution at position 367, was more active than human n2 on multivalent substrates containing α2,3-linked sias, corresponding with the pronounced binding-specificity of avian-like n2 for these receptors. when introduced into human viruses, avian-like n2 gave rise to altered plaque morphology and decreased replication compared to human n2. an opposite replication phenotype was observed when n2 was combined with avian-like ha. specific bio-layer interferometry assays revealed a clear effect of the 2sbs on the dynamic interaction of virus particles with receptors. the absence or presence of a functional 2sbs affected virion-receptor binding and receptor cleavage required for particle movement on a receptor-coated surface and subsequent na-dependent self-elution. the contribution of the 2sbs to virus-receptor interactions depended on the receptor-binding properties of ha and the identity of the receptors used. we conclude that the 2sbs is an important and underappreciated determinant of the ha-na-receptor balance. the rapid loss of a functional 2sbs in pandemic viruses may have served to balance the novel host receptor-repertoire and altered receptor-binding properties of the corresponding ha protein.', '31015836': 'influenza a viruses (iav) are evolutionarily successful pathogens, capable of infecting a number of avian and mammalian species and responsible for pandemic and seasonal epidemic disease in humans. to infect new species, iav typically must overcome a number of species barriers to entry, replication, and egress, even while virus replication is counteracted by antiviral host factors and innate immune mechanisms. a number of host factors have been found to regulate the replication of iav by interacting with the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp). the host factor parp1, a poly-adp ribosyl polymerase, was required for optimal functions of human, swine, and avian influenza rdrp in human 293t cells. in iav infection, parp1 was required for efficient synthesis of viral nucleoprotein (np) in human lung a549 cells. intriguingly, pharmacological inhibition of parp1 enzymatic activity (parylation) by 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide led to a 4-fold increase in rdrp activity, and a 2.3-fold increase in virus titer. exogenous expression of the natural parylation inhibitor parg also enhanced rdrp activity.

i interferon and nf-κb induction in host defense against viral infection. in this study, we found that trim14 could restrict the replication of iav in a type i interferon and nf-κb independent manner. mechanistically, different domains of trim14 could selectively interact with the viral nucleoprotein (np), resulting in disparate influences on the rnp formation and viral replication. in particular, the pryspry domain of trim14 exhibited a potent inhibitory activity on np protein stability and iav replication. on the contrary, the δs2 domain could rather antagonize the function of pryspry domain and promote the iav rnp formation by stabilizing np. at the biochemical level, trim14-np interaction could induce the k48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of np. moreover, due to the rapid degradation of newly synthesized np, trim14 could effectively block the translocation of np from cytoplasm to nucleus thus further restrain the propagation of iav in host cells. taken together,

can spread in the human population and cause pandemics with more or less severe course of the disease. presently, however, the potential of avian iav to infect humans and to cause the disease cannot be predicted. many studies are therefore focused on factors influencing the virulence and pathogenicity of iav viruses in a given host. the virus-host interaction starts by virus attachment via the envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (ha) to the receptors on the cell surface. in addition to receptor binding, ha mediates also the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, which follows the virus endocytosis. the fusion potential of ha trimer, primed by proteolytic cleavage, is activated by low ph in endosomes, resulting in ha refolding into the fusion-active form. the ha conformation change is predetermined by its 3-d structure, is ph-dependent, irreversible and strain-specific. the process of fusion activation of iav hemagglutinin is crucial for virus entry into the cell and for the

replication depends on the interaction of virus proteins with host factors. the viral nonstructural protein 1 (ns1) is essential in this process by targeting diverse cellular functions, including mrna splicing and translation, cell survival, and immune defense, in particular the type i interferon (ifn-i) response. in order to identify host proteins targeted by ns1, we established a replication-competent recombinant iav that expresses epitope-tagged forms of ns1 and ns2, which are encoded by the same gene segment, allowing purification of ns proteins during natural cell infection and analysis of interacting proteins by quantitative mass spectrometry. we identified known ns1- and ns2-interacting proteins but also uncharacterized proteins, including pact, an important cofactor for the ifn-i response triggered by the viral rna-sensor rig-i. we show here that ns1 binds pact during virus replication and blocks pact/rig-i-mediated activation of ifn-i, which represents a critical event for the host defense. protein interaction and interference with ifn-i activation depended on the functional integrity of the highly conserved rna binding domain of ns1. a mutant virus with deletion of ns1 induced high levels of ifn-i in control cells, as expected; in contrast, shrna-mediated knockdown of pact compromised ifn-i activation by the mutant virus, but not wild-type virus, a finding consistent with the interpretation that pact (i) is essential for iav recognition and (ii) is functionally compromised by ns1. together, our data describe a novel approach to identify virus-host protein interactions and demonstrate that ns1 interferes with pact, whose function is critical for robust ifn-i production.\\nimportance: influenza a virus (iav) is an important human pathogen that is responsible for annual epidemics and occasional devastating pandemics. viral replication and pathogenicity depends on the interference of viral factors with components of the host defense system, particularly the type i interferon (ifn-i) response. the viral ns1 protein is known to counteract virus recognition and ifn-i production, but the molecular mechanism is only partially defined. we used a novel proteomic approach to identify host proteins that are bound by ns1 during virus replication and identified the protein pact, which had previously been shown to be involved in virus-mediated ifn-i activation. we find that ns1 prevents pact from interacting with an essential component of the virus recognition pathway, rig-i, thereby disabling efficient ifn-i production.

iav. importantly, the np-actinin-4 interaction was observed in several iav subtypes, including the 2009 h1n1 pandemic virus. moreover, immunofluorescence studies revealed that both np and actinin-4 co-localized largely around the nucleus and also in the cytoplasmic region of virus-infected a549 cells. silencing of actinin-4 expression resulted in not only a significant decrease in np, m2 and ns1 viral protein expression, but also a reduction of both np mrna and viral rna levels, as well as viral titers, 24 h post-infection with iav, suggesting that actinin-4 was critical for viral replication. furthermore, actinin-4 depletion reduced the amount of np localized in the nucleus. treatment of infected cells with wortmannin, a known inhibitor of actinin-4, led to a decrease in np mrna levels and also caused the nuclear retention of np, further strengthening our previous observations. taken together, the results of the present study indicate that actinin-4, a novel interacting

the role of na in viral exit is well established: it releases budding virions by cleaving sias from glycoconjugates on infected cells and progeny virions. the role of na in viral entry remains unclear. host respiratory epithelia secrete a mucus layer rich in heavily sialylated glycoproteins; these could inhibit viral entry by mimicking sialylated receptors on the cell surface. it has been suggested that na allows influenza to penetrate the mucus by cleaving these sialylated decoys, but the exact mechanism is not yet established.\\nmethods: we tested iav interaction with secreted mucus using frozen human trachea/bronchus tissue sections, and bead-bound purified human salivary mucins (hsm) and purified porcine submaxillary mucins (psm). the protective effect of mucus was analyzed using mdck cells coated with purified hsm and psm with known sia content. oseltamivir was used to inhibit na activity, and the fluorescent reporter substrate, 4mu-neu5ac, was used to quantify na activity.\\nresults: iav binds to the secreted mucus layer of frozen human trachea/bronchus tissues in a sia dependent manner. hsm inhibition of iav infection is sia dose-dependent, but psm cannot inhibit infection of underlying cells. hsm competitively inhibits na cleavage of 4mu-neu5ac, reporter substrate. human iav effectively cleaves sias from hsm but not from psm, and binds to hsm but not to psm.\\nconclusion: iav interacts with human mucus on frozen tissue sections and mucus-coated beads. inhibition of iav infection by sialylated human mucus is dose-dependent, and enhanced when na is

studies showed that np and hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus. during iav infection in mammalian cells, expression of np coincided with the dissociation of p58(ipk) from hsp40 and decrease pkr phosphorylation. we observed that, plasmid based expression of np in mammalian cells leads to decrease in pkr phosphorylation. furthermore, inhibition of np expression during influenza virus replication led to pkr activation and concomitant increase in eif2α phosphorylation. inhibition of np expression also led to reduced irf3 phosphorylation, enhanced ifn β production and concomitant

biogenesis, rna maturation, stress response, and control of cell growth, but the functional consequences of this are unclear. we took an unbiased approach to studying iav-nucleolar interactions by using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (silac) in conjunction with lc-ms/ms to quantify changes in the nucleolar proteome following infection with a/pr/8/34 (h1n1) and a/udorn/72 (h3n2) strains of the virus. only a minority of nucleolar proteins showed significant changes in abundance after infection; these alterations were mostly different between the two strains but could be validated by confocal microscopy of infected cells. many of the affected proteins comprised functional groupings, including components of ribonuclease p, rna polymerase i, the mll1 histone methyltransferase complex, as well as nuclear paraspeckles and the rna editing apparatus. this, as well as comparison with other viruses that cause changes in the nucleolar proteome, suggests that iav targets specific nucleolar pathways.', '17311557': 'influenza a virus (iav) is one of the most common infectious pathogens in humans. since iva genome does not have the processing protease for the viral membrane fusion glycoprotein precursors, entry of this virus into cells is determined primarily by host cellular, trypsin-type, processing proteases that proteolytically activate the fusion glycoprotein precursors of iav. at least five different processing proteases have been identified in the airways of animals and humans. these proteases determine the infectious organ tropism of iav infection as well as the efficiency of viral multiplication in the airway, and sometimes in the brain. proteases in the upper respiratory tract are suppressed by secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, and those in the lower respiratory tract are suppressed by pulmonary surfactant which, by adsorption, inhibits the interaction between the proteases and viral membrane proteins. since protease activities predominate over those of endogenous inhibitory compounds under normal airway conditions, administration of protease inhibitors in the early-stage of infection significantly suppresses viral entry and viral multiplication. several viral neuraminidase inhibitors are used clinically as anti-influenza virus agents, based on their inhibitory action on viral release from infected cells. furthermore, protease inhibitors of viral entry could be potentially useful against influenza virus as well as neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses. we also found that ambroxol, a mucolytic and anti-oxidant agent, up-regulates the levels of endogenous protease inhibitory compounds in the airway fluids in early-phase infection, and that clarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, increases iga levels and mucosal immunity through augmentation of interleukin-12 levels in the airway. the combination of neuraminidase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, clarithromycin or ambroxol, could be potentially used as a potent anti-influenza therapy to minimize the emergence of drug-resistant mutant viruses.', '15576322': 'influenza a virus (iav) is one of the most common infectious pathogens in humans. entry of this virus into cells is primarily determined by host cellular trypsin-type processing proteases, which proteolytically activate viral membrane fusion glycoprotein precursors. human iav and murine parainfluenza virus type 1 sendai virus are exclusively pneumotropic, and the infectious organ tropism of these viruses is determined by the susceptibility of the viral envelope glycoprotein to cleavage by proteases in the airway. proteases in the upper respiratory tract are suppressed by secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, and those in the lower respiratory tract are suppressed by pulmonary surfactant, which by adsorption inhibits the interaction between the proteases and viral membrane proteins. although the protease activities are predominant over the activities of inhibitory compounds under normal airway conditions, intranasal administration of inhibitors was able to significantly suppress multi-cycles of viral replication in the airway. in addition, we identified chemical agents that could act as defensive factors by up-regulating the levels of the natural inhibitors and immunoglobulin a (iga) in airway fluids. one of these compounds, ambroxol, is a mucolytic and anti-oxidant agent that stimulates the release of secretory leukoprotease inhibitor and pulmonary surfactant in the early phase, and iga in the late phase of infection at an optimal dose, i.e. a dose sufficient to inhibit virus proliferation and increase the survival rate of animals after treatment with a lethal dose of iav. another agent, clarithromycin, is a macrolide antibiotic that increases iga levels through augmentation of interleukin-12 levels and mucosal immunization in the airway. in addition to the sialidase inhibitors, which prevent the release of iav from infected cells, inhibitors of the processing proteases and chemical agents that augment mucosal immunity and/or levels of the relevant defensive compounds may also ultimately prove to be useful as new anti-influenza agents.'}\n",
